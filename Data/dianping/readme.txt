The methodology of sentiment polarity labelling and feature-opinion pair extraction are presented in [1] and [2] respectively, and this dataset is used for explanable recommendation in [3].

Data Format:

A user review is formatted as an XML entry of the form:

<DOC>
userid itemid flavor_rating environment_rating service_rating
review_text
feature-opinion pairs matched in the review_text, each of the form [feature_word, opinion_word, sentiment_polarity, times_of_ occurrence, reversed_or_not]
</DOC>

e.g. [service, good, +1, 1, Y] means that the pair 'service | good' is matched for once in the review, and the pair itself represents a positive sentiment (+1), however, it is reversed (Y means that it is indeed reversed, and N is not reversed) by a negation word (e.g. 'not'), so the final sentiment of this pair in this review would be negative.
